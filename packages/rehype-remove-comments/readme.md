## What is this?

This package is a plugin that removes comments.
By default it keeps conditional comments, optionally it removes them too.

## When should I use this?

You can use this plugin when you want to improve the transfer size of HTML
documents.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-remove-comments
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import rehypeRemoveComments from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-remove-comments@5?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeRemoveComments from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-remove-comments@5?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import rehypeRemoveComments from 'rehype-remove-comments'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(rehypeParse)
    .use(rehypeRemoveComments)
    .use(rehypeStringify)
    .process(await read('index.html'))

  console.log(String(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
rehype input.html --use rehype-remove-comments --output output.html
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "rehype": {
   "plugins": [
     …
+    "rehype-remove-comments",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `rehypeRemoveComments`.

### `unified().use(rehypeRemoveComments[, options])`

Remove comments.

##### `options`

Configuration (optional).

###### `options.removeConditional`

Whether to remove conditional comments too (`boolean`, default: `false`).
The default behavior is to keep conditional comments.
Conditional comments are a legacy feature that was specific to Internet
Explorer.
They were no longer used in IE 10.

## Example

###### In

```html
<!--Hello-->
<!--[if IE 6]>OK<![endif]-->
```

###### Out

```html
<!--[if IE 6]>OK<![endif]-->
```

## Syntax

HTML is handled according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree format used is [`hast`][hast].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.
