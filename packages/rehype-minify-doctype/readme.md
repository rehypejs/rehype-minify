## What is this?

This package is a plugin that turns the doctype, when found, into an HTML 5
doctype (`<!doctype html>`).
This plugin is no longer needed, because hast no longer supports other
doctypes.

## When should I use this?

You should not use this plugin anymore.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-minify-doctype
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import rehypeMinifyDoctype from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-minify-doctype@3?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeMinifyDoctype from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-minify-doctype@3?min'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import rehypeMinifyDoctype from 'rehype-minify-doctype'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(rehypeParse)
    .use(rehypeMinifyDoctype)
    .use(rehypeStringify)
    .process(await read('index.html'))

  console.log(String(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
rehype input.html --use rehype-minify-doctype --output output.html
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "rehype": {
   "plugins": [
     …
+    "rehype-minify-doctype",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `rehypeMinifyDoctype`.

### `unified().use(rehypeMinifyDoctype)`

Minify the doctype.
There are no options.

## Example

###### In

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"><html><head></head><body></body></html>
```

###### Out

```html
<!doctype html><html><head></head><body></body></html>
```

## Syntax

HTML is handled according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree format used is [`hast`][hast].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.
