## What is this?

This package contains info on which HTML elements are whitespace sensitive.

## When should I use this?

This is only really needed when minifying HTML.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install html-whitespace-sensitive-tag-names
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```js
import {whitespaceSensitiveTagNames} from 'https://esm.sh/html-whitespace-sensitive-tag-names@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {whitespaceSensitiveTagNames} from 'https://esm.sh/html-whitespace-sensitive-tag-names@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {whitespaceSensitiveTagNames} from 'html-whitespace-sensitive-tag-names'

whitespaceSensitiveTagNames
//=> ['pre', 'script', 'style', 'textarea']
```

## API

This package exports the identifier
`whitespaceSensitiveTagNames`.
There is no default export.

### `whitespaceSensitiveTagNames`

List of HTML tag names that are whitespace sensitive (`Array<string>`).

## Syntax

HTML is parsed according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by all browsers.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree used is [hast][].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`html-whitespace-sensitive-tag-names@^3`,
compatible with Node.js 16.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.
