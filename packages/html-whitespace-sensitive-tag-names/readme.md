## What is this?

This package contains info on which HTML elements are whitespace sensitive.

## When should I use this?

This is only really needed when minifying HTML.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install html-whitespace-sensitive-tag-names
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import {whitespaceSensitiveTagNames} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/html-whitespace-sensitive-tag-names@2?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {whitespaceSensitiveTagNames} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/html-whitespace-sensitive-tag-names@2?min'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {whitespaceSensitiveTagNames} from 'html-whitespace-sensitive-tag-names'

whitespaceSensitiveTagNames
//=> ['pre', 'script', 'style', 'textarea']
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers:
`whitespaceSensitiveTagNames`.
There is no default export.

### `whitespaceSensitiveTagNames`

List of whitespace sensitive HTML tag names (`Array<string>`).

## Syntax

HTML is handled according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree format used is [`hast`][hast].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.
