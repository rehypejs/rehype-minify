## What is this?

This package is a plugin that sorts attribute values, which optimizes for
repetition-based compression (such as GZip).

## When should I use this?

You can use this plugin when you want to improve the transfer size of HTML
documents.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-sort-attribute-values
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```js
import rehypeSortAttributeValues from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-sort-attribute-values@5'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeSortAttributeValues from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-sort-attribute-values@5?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeSortAttributeValues from 'rehype-sort-attribute-values'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const file = await unified()
  .use(rehypeParse)
  .use(rehypeSortAttributeValues)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process(await read('index.html'))

console.log(String(file))
```

On the CLI:

```sh
rehype input.html --use rehype-sort-attribute-values --output output.html
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "rehype": {
   "plugins": [
     …
+    "rehype-sort-attribute-values",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `rehypeSortAttributeValues`.

### `unified().use(rehypeSortAttributeValues)`

Sort attribute values.

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer`](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#transformer)).

## Example

###### In

```html
<div class="qux quux foo bar"></div>
```

###### Out

```html
<div class="bar foo quux qux"></div>
```

## Syntax

HTML is parsed according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by all browsers.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree used is [hast][].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`rehype-sort-attribute-values@^5`,
compatible with Node.js 16.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.
