## What is this?

This package is a utility to get the plain-text value of a node.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package when you want to get the plain text value of a node.
The algorithm used by this package is like the DOMs `Node#textContent`
getter.

To use the DOMs `Node#innerText` algorithm instead, use
[`hast-util-to-text`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-to-text).
`innerText` is aware of how things are displayed, for example turning hard
breaks (`<br>`) into line endings.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install hast-util-to-string
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import {toString} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/hast-util-to-string@2?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {toString} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/hast-util-to-string@2?min'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {h} from 'hastscript'
import {toString} from 'hast-util-to-string'

toString(h('p', 'Alpha'))
//=> 'Alpha'
toString(h('div', [h('b', 'Bold'), ' and ', h('i', 'italic'), '.']))
//=> 'Bold and italic.'
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers:
`toString`.
There is no default export.

### `toString(node)`

Get the plain-text value of a node.

###### Parameters

*   `node` (`Node`) — hast node

###### Returns

Serialized node (`string`).

## Syntax

HTML is handled according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree format used is [`hast`][hast].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.
